,Definitions,,,,,,,,
,Natural Lands,"Natural lands are either pristine or reclaimed areas that are open to the public and left largely undisturbed and managed for their conservation and ecological value (i.e., wetlands, forests, deserts). While they may have trails and occasional benches, they are not developed for any recreation activities beyond walking, running, and cycling. ",,,,,,,
,Designed lands,"Designed lands are parklands that have been created, constructed, planted, and managed primarily for human use. They include playgrounds, neighborhood parks, mini-parks, picnic meadows, sports fields, plazas, boulevards, municipal golf courses, municipal cemeteries, and all areas served by roadways, parking lots and service buildings and facilities.",,,,,,,
,Undeveloped,This is land owned by your agency but that has not yet been formally opened or developed for public use and is not managed or patrolled.,,,,,,,
,Non-parkland,"Non-parkland is land owned and/or managed by your agency that does not fit into the categories in above questions. It might include right-of-ways, medians, etc.",,,,,,,
